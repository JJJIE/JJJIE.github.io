	<p>The last time you woke up from a dream, you may have wondered why exactly you were back at high school, standing in front of your locker, unable for the life of you to remember the combination.</p>
	<p>When it comes to dream meanings, most of us expect those visions to reveal mental health truths, whether they be feelings about a life event, relationship or simply a memory.</p>
	<p>But after recent research highlighted a potential link between acting out dreams and a common form of dementia, perhaps there is more we can learn about our physical health from our dreams.</p>
	<h3>You Have A Fever</h3>
	<p>If you're the type to ignore the signs that you're under the weather, maybe a freaky nightmare will prove the point.</p>
	<p>Being sick can trigger nightmares, according to the Mayo Clinic, especially if your illness is accompanied by a fever.</p>
	<p>If you weren't paying attention to what your body was trying to tell you before, the morning after that weird nightmare is the time to tune in!</p>
	<h3>Stress Is Getting The Best Of You</h3>
	<p>You might also be ignoring signs that you're more than a little stressed out. </p>
	<p>When we ignore what's taxing us, those stressors can follow us to bed.</p>
	<p>Sometimes, stress can manifest itself as common dream themes like missing a plane or an oncoming tidal wave, according to DoctorOz.com. </p>
	<p>Other times, a particularly bizarre dream might help you realize it's time to slow down.</p>
	<p>Some say that stress dreams might actually be helpful if they reveal what's truly bothering you and point to why you're feeling that way.</p>
	<h3>Your Blood Sugar Could Be Low</h3>
	<p>If people with diabetes experience a serious dip in blood sugar, one possible symptom can be bad dreams and nightmares, according to WebMD. </p>
	<p>Taking too much insulin or certain medications can cause this drop, called hypoglycemia.</p>
	<p>Of course, most people with diabetes will learn to recognize early symptoms of low blood sugar before nightmares point out the problem.</p>
	<p>But hypoglycemia can occur during sleep.</p>
