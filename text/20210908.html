	<p>He was once a good friend of mine.</p>
	<p>One day, he asked me about a sword art of which he had heard, the "Musou no Hitotachi".</p>
	<p>I told him: </p>
	<p>It can only be witnessed when divine punishment is administered.</p>
	<p>It is the pinnacle of the Raiden Shogun's skill.</p>
	<p>A symbol of ultimate power.</p>
	<p>But he replied: </p>
	<p>There must be one who can withstand it. </p>
	<p>There will always be those who dare to brave the lightning's glow.</p>
	<p>Then the Vision Hunt Decree arrived.</p>
	<p>People's aspirations were stripped away as the Raiden Shogun began to construct her ideal of eternity.</p>
	<p>While I was fleeing from place to place.</p>
	<p>I heard that my friend had challenged the Vision Hunters to a duel before the throne.</p>
	<p>A solemn yet brutal challenge.</p>
	<p>The defeated face divine punishment, while the victors gain a second change.</p>
	<p>Perhaps he thought he of all people should make a stand.</p>
	<p>Coming face to face with the Musou no Hitotachi was all that he truly desired, after all.</p>
	<p>When I arrived at Tenshukaku, the duel was over. </p>
	<p>I heard his sentence of divine punishment.</p>
	<p>His severed blade hitting the ground.</p>
	<p>Perhaps that was the glory he had yearned to witness.</p>
	<p>In his last moments, what expression was on his face.</p>
	<p>Before I knew it, I had stepped forward and snatched the dying Vision. And was running from the scene.</p>
	<p>All I knew was that I mustn’t let his hope which burned so brightly become buried among the ice-cold statue of god.</p>
