	<p>While most see plants as a key part of nature —— one that makes sure humanity doesn't run out of air, provides foods, and makes the world more beautiful —— there's more than meets the eye.</p>
	<p>Meet Suzie Grieve of Foraged Fibres, a wild basket and jewelry maker from Lake District, UK who weaves miniatrue baskets as well as tiny jewelry using leaves, vines and weeds.</p>
	<p>Suzie Grieve is a self-taught wild basket and jewlry maker from Lake District, a region and national park in Cumbria in northwest England.</p>
	<p>Grieve weaves miniature baskets and tiny jewelry using dried leaves, vines, and weeds. She also weaves regular-sized baskets, if you are wondering.</p>
	<p>"The first time I wove anything was whilst I was living in an community in central France. It was my job to create vegetable beds so I used the abundantly growing hazel to weave the edges," Grieve explained the origins of her endeavor.</p>
	<p>"Whilst weaving the sticks in place, I felt an immediate connection to the craft, the simple meditative rhythm of the weaving, the beautiful tactile way in which it allows you to connect with the land and the feelingof self reliance. To be able to create with only your hands and what's growing around you is an amazing feeling."</p>
