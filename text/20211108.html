	<h3>Into the Primitive</h3>

	<p>"Old longings nomadic leap, Chafing at custom's chain; Again from its brumal sleep Wakens the ferine strain."</p>
	<p class="text_ch">驰骋原野的古老渴望，挣扎与世俗的阻碍；野性的血脉在流淌，终将从冬眠中醒来。</p>
	<p>Buck did not read the newspapers, or he would have known that trouble was brewing, not alone for himself, but for every tide-water dog, strong of muscle and with warm, long hair, from Puget Sound to San Diego.</p>
	<p class="text_ch">Buck不懂看报，否则他就会知道有麻烦要降临了。这麻烦不仅属于他，也属于从Puget Sound到San Diego的每一条狗。</p>
	<p>Because men, groping in the Arctic darkness, had found a yellow metal, and because steamship and transportation companies were booming the find, thousands of men were rushing into the Northland.</p>
	<p class="text_ch">这是因为，那些在北极地带的黑暗中摸索的人，找到了一种黄色的金属，再加上汽船和运输公司的推波助澜，使得数以千计的人朝着北国蜂拥而去。</p>
	<p>These men wanted dogs, and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs, with strong muscles by which to toil, and furry coats to protect them from the frost.</p>
	<p class="text_ch">这些人需要狗，他们需要的是大型的狗，有着强健的肌肉好吃苦耐劳，有着厚实的皮毛可以抵御寒冷。</p>
	<p>Buck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley. Judge Miller's place, it was called.</p>
	<p class="text_ch">Buck住在颇受阳光眷顾的Santa Clara谷的一所大房子里，人们称之为米勒法官大宅。</p>
	<p>It stood back from the road, half hidden among the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the wide cool veranda that ran around its four sides.</p>
	<p class="text_ch">宅子离大路有一段距离，掩映在绿树丛中，透过树丛，人们可以看到宅子四边那宽阔透风的游廊。</p>
	<p>The house was approached by gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns and under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars.</p>
	<p class="text_ch">砾石铺就的车道蜿蜒穿过开阔的草坪，上方有枝桠交叉的高大杨树，一路可以直抵宅子跟前。</p>
	<p>At the rear things were on even a more spacious scale than at the front.</p>
	<p class="text_ch">而宅子后面甚至要比宅子前面还要空旷开阔。</p>
	<p>There were great stables, where a dozen grooms and boys held forth, rows of vine-clad servants' cottages, an endless and orderly array of outhouses, long grape arbors, green pastures, orchards, and berry patches.</p>
	<p class="text_ch">那里有巨大的马厩，里面有十几个马夫与僮仆；有一排排爬满藤蔓的仆人住的小屋，有看似没有尽头却安排的井然有序的外屋，有葡萄长廊、绿色草场、果园和一片片莓果地。</p>
	<p>Then there was the pumping plant for the artesian well, and the big cement tank where Judge Miller's boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon.</p>
	<p class="text_ch">此外，还有供喷水井使用的泵水设备和一个大大的水泥蓄水池，米勒法官家的男孩子们早上会在那里玩跳水，炎热的下午则泡在里面纳凉。</p>
