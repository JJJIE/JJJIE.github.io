	<p>The story starts more simply: Just you, and a circle.</p>
	<p>Let's say with radius 3.</p>
	<p>You're trying to figure out its area, and after going through a lot of paper trying different ways to chop up and rearrange the pieces of that area.</p>
	<p>Many of which might lead to their own insteresing observations.</p>
	<p>Maybe you try out the idea of slicing up the circle into many concentric rings.</p>
	<p>This should seem promising because it respects the symmetry of the circle and math has tendency to reward you when you respect its symmetry.</p>
	<p>Let's take one of these rings, which has some inner radius r that's between 0 and 3.</p>
	<p>If we can find a nice expression for the area of each ring like this one and if we have a nice way to add them all up, it might lead us to an understanding of the full circle's area.</p>
	<p>Maybe you start by imagining straightening out this ring, and you could try thinking through exactly what this new shape is and what its area should be.</p>
	<p>But for simplicity, let's just approximate it as a rectangle.</p>
	<p>The width of that rectangle is the circumference of the original ring, which is 2pi*r, right?</p>
	<p>I mean, that's essentially the definition of pi.</p>
	<p>And its thickness depends on how finely you chopped up the circle in the first place, which was kind of arbitrary.</p>
	<p>In the spirit of using what will come to be standard calculus notation, let's call that thickness "dr" for a tiny difference in the radius from one ring to the next.</p>
	<p>Maybe you think of it as something like 0.1.</p>
	<p>So, approximating this unwrapped ring as a thin rectangle, its area is 2pi times r, the radius, times dr, the little thickness.</p>
	<p>And even though that's not perfect, for smaller and smaller choices of dr, this is actually going to be better and better approximation for that area.</p>
	<p>Since the top and bottom sides of this shape are going to get closer and closer to being exactly the same length.</p>
	<p>So let's just move forward with this approximation, keeping in the back of out minds that it's slightly wrong, but it's going to become more accurate for smaller and smaller choices of dr.</p>
	<p>That is, if we slice the circle into thinner and thinner rings.</p>
