	<p>It doesn't matter who you are or what you typically think of math, that right there is a beautiful argument.</p>
	<p>But if you want to think like a mathematician here, you don't just care about finding the answer, you care about developing general problem solving rools and techniques.</p>
	<p>So take a moment to meditate on what exactly just happend, and why it worked, because the way we transitioned from something approximate to something precise is actually pretty subtle, and it cuts deep to what calculus is all about.</p>
	<p>You had this problem that could be approximated with the sum of many small numbers, each of which looked like 2pir times dr for values of r ranging between 0 and 3.</p>
	<p>Remember, the small number dr here represents out choice for the thickness of each ring, for example 0.1.</p>
	<p>And there are two important things to note here.</p>
	<p>First of all, not only is dr a factor in the quantity we're adding up, 2pi*r times dr, it also gives the spacing between the different values of r.</p>
	<p>And secondly, the smaller our choice for dr, the better the approximation.</p>
	<p>Adding all of those numbers could be seen in different pretty clever way as adding up the areas of many thin rectangles sitting underneath this graph.</p>
	<p>The graph of the function 2pi*r in this case.</p>
	<p>Then,  and this is key, by considering smaller and smaller choices for dr, corresponding to better and better approximations of the original problem, this sum, thought of as the aggregate area of all these rectangles, approaches the area under the graph.</p>
	<p>And because of that, you can conclude that the answer to the original question, in full, un-approximated precsion, is exactly the same as the area underneath this graph.</p>
	<p>A lot of other hard problems in math and science can be broken down and approximated as the sum of many small quantities.</p>
	<p>Things like figuring out how far a car has traveled base on its velocity at each point in time.</p>
	<p>In a case like that, you might range through many different points in time, and each one multiply the velocity at that by a tiny change in time dt, which would give the corresponding little bit of distance traveled during that little time.</p>
	<p>At a high level, many of these types of problems turn out to be equivalent to finding the area under some graph, in much the same way that our circle problem did.</p>
	<p>This happends whenever the quantities that you're adding up, the ones whose sum approximates the original problem, can be thought of as the area of many thin rectangles sitting side-by-side like this.</p>
	<p>If finer and finer approximations of the original problem correspond to thinner and thinner rings, then the original problem is going to be equivalent to finding the area under some graph.</p>
	<p>Again, this is an idea we'll see in more detail later in the series, so don't worry if it's not 100% clear right now.</p>
	<p>The point now is that you, as the mathematician, having just solved a problem by reframing it as an area under a graph, might start thinking about how to find the areas under other graphs.</p>
