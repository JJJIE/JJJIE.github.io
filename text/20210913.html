	<p>Just to sum up where we are, you've broken up the area of the circle into all of these rings.</p>
	<p>And you're approximating the area of each one of those as 2pi*(its radius)*dr, where the specific value for that inner radius ranges from 0 for the smallest ting, up to just under 3 for the biggest ring, space out by whatever the thickness is that you chose for dr, something like 0.1.</p>
	<p>And notice that the spacing between the values here corresponds to the thickness dr of each ring, the difference in radius from one ring to the next.</p>
	<p>In fact, a nice way to think about the rectangles approximating each ring's area is to fit them all upright, side-by-side along this axis.</p>
	<p>Each one has a thickness dr, which is why they fitso snugly right there together.</p>
	<p>And the height of any one of these rectangles, sitting above some specific value of r, like 0.6, is exactly 2pi*(that value).</p>
	<p>This is the circumference of the corresponding ring that this rectangle approximates.</p>
	<p>A nice way to think about this setup is to draw the graph of 2pi*r, which is a straight line that has a slope of 2pi.</p>
	<p>Each of these rectangles extends up to the point where it just barely touches that graph.</p>
	<p>Again, we're being approximate here.</p>
	<p>Each of these rectangles only approximates the area of the corresponding ring from the circle.</p>
	<p>But remember, that approximation 2pi*r*dr, gets less and less wrong as the size of dr gets smaller and smaller.</p>
	<p>And this has a very beautiful meaning when we're looking at the sum of the areas of all these rectangles.</p>
	<p>For smaller and smaller choices of dr, you might at frist think that it truns the problem into a monstrously large sum.</p>
	<p>I mean, there are many many rectangles to comsider, and the decimal precision on each of their areas is going to be an absolute nightmare.</p>
	<p>But notice, all of their areas in aggregate just looks like the area under a graph.</p>
	<p>And that portion under the graph is just a triangle.</p>
	<p>A triangle with a base of 3, and a height that's 2pi*3.</p>
	<p>So its area, 1/2 base height, works out to be exactly pi*3^2.</p>
	<p>Or if the radius of our original circle was some other value, capital R, that area comes out to be pi*R^2.</p>
	<p>And that's the formula for the area of a circle.</p>
