	<p>Driven by the winds and rains, half of the autumn has already passed as Qiu Fen, or the Autumnal Equinox, ushers us into the remaining half of the season before the dreaded winter sets in.</p>
	<p>Qiu Fen, which marks the 16th of the 24 solar terms and divides the autumn into two halves, falls on Thursday this year.</p>
	<p>It is the occasion when night and day are almost equal in length for the second time in a year, after Vernal Equinox, or Chun Fen.</p>
	<p>In the following days, as the nights grow longer and the days turn shorter, flora and fauna across China will begin to wither away.</p>
	<p>According to old Chinese wisdom, this is the period when "thunders begin to soften, insects start making nests and water begins to dry up."</p>
	<h3>Golden hue in farmlands</h3>
	<p>Autumn is also one of the busiest periods for farmers, who have traditionally been guided by the 24 solar terms for their agricultural activities. </p>
	<p>The practice continues even today.</p>
	<p>This is when harvesting, plowing and planting are underway at the same time in farmlands.</p>
	<p>In northern China, it is considered the best time to harvest cottons for instance. </p>
	<p>It is also a crucial time to plant winter wheat.</p>
	<p>In the south, farmers usually harvest rice during the season while at the same time plow the fields on sunny days, to get them ready for rapeseed plantation. </p>
	<p>They need to pay extra attention to irrigation, as rainy days are far and few in between.</p>
	<p>Golden color - the color of harvest - adorn most Chinese villages during this time, as farmers bask grains, corns and other crops on their farmlands and courtyards.</p>
	<h3>Ancient festival and rituals</h3>
	<p>In ancient times, Qiu Fen was marked as an important festival - the day to worship the moon. </p>
	<p>It is believed to be the origin of the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
	<p>According to historic records, the Chinese monarchs had the ritual of worshiping the sun, the moon, the earth and the heaven respectively in the four seasons as early as the Zhou Dynasty (1046 BCE-256 BCE).</p>
	<p>Even today, there are many ancient pavilions, altars and buildings named after these rituals.</p>
